# di504-project-face-emotion-recognition
for di504 course at metu. this is a deep learning project for face emotion recognition with different cnns.

----------
Default parameters: optimiser: Adam, learning_rate=0.0001, loss = categorical_crossentropy, metrics = accuracy, epochs: 50/100

Some callbacks: early stopping, reduce learning rate
